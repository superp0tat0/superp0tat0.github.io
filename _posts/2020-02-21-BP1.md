Academic Auto Marker for Python files.

Introduction
------
The default Unit Test built in Python is good for Unit Test purpose. However it is not easy to modify for entering marks in csv format etc. It is also quite a challeng to assign marks to all students' assignments once there is a huge class. Thus I shared the following academic auto marker designed to mark python assignments. I have already include the documents in .py files. But I would do a step by step introduction so it would be convinient for a reuse purpose.


Test Cases Class
------
So first we need to create a Class to contain all of our Test Cases. The time is essential since you do not want your program stop because some infinite loop inside some student's files. I add some time exceptions for all of the test cases. Where you could adjust the time you want for specific test cases.
You could define how many marks you want to give once student fail on a specific case on pass a specific case. All examples are given below.
You could create multiple classes if you have multiple questions.

```
from os import walk
import signal
import numpy as np
import tarfile
import sys
import csv

#Define time out Error handler
def handler(signum, frame):
    raise Exception("Timeout")

class Course_Q2_Test(): # 7 marks in total

    def __init__(self):
        #register timeout handler
        signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, handler)

        #Set up
        '''
        You could set up the parameters for test here.
        '''

    def run(self):
        _current_score = 0
        #Set countdown to 15 sec
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test1(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=2)) # 1 mark
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test2(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=4)) # 1 mark
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test3(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=4)) # 1 mark
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test4(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=7)) # 2 marks
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test5(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=2)) # 1 mark
        signal.alarm(15); _current_score += self.test6(atol=1e-07, model = pr.PolynomialRegression(K=4)) # 1 mark
        return(_current_score)

    #Test Case 1
    def test1(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 1
        except:
            return 0

    #Test Case 2
    def test2(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 1
        except:
            return 0

    #Test case 3
    def test3(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 1
        except:
            return 0
    
    #Test case 4
    def test4(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 2
        except:
            return 0

    #Test case 5
    def test5(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 1
        except:
            return 0

    #Test case 6
    def test6(self, atol, model):
        try:
            return 1
        except:
            return 0
```

Output marks to CSV files
------
Once a student is marked, I want to input the marks to CSV files intend to upload to course website or store. So I also automated the following process.
The logic is simple. Because all the submissions are sharing the same format. And All files are compressed. So here are the logics to mark assignment
1. Create Test instances.
1. Read the structure of current file system.
1. Extract the compressed file and store current student's identity
1. Insert student's directory to working path
1. Import student's python scirpts
1. Execute the test cases
1. Write the result to CSV files

Here are the codes:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    #Read all files in the below dir
    mypath = "/home/siyi/Desktop/test"
    #Create auto test instance
    Q2 = Course_Q2_Test()
    error = False #Import Error handler

    #file writter stand by
    with open('A1_grades_auto.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["Student_ID", "Q2"])

        for (dirpath, dirnames, filenames) in walk(mypath):

            #assume only one most hidden file
            #some students have .tgz or .tar.gz file type
            if(len(filenames) >= 1 and ".tgz" in filenames[0]) or (len(filenames) >= 2 and ".tgz" in filenames[1] or
            len(filenames) >= 1 and ".tar" in filenames[0]) or (len(filenames) >= 2 and ".tar" in filenames[1]):

                remove = dirpath[0:dirpath.rfind("/")]
                student_id = remove[remove.rfind("/")+1:] #Get the student ID

                #get the tgz file depends on location: Add if case for some hidden files
                if(".tgz" in filenames[0] or ".tar" in filenames[0]):
                    path = (dirpath + "/" + filenames[0])
                elif(".tgz" in filenames[1] or ".tar" in filenames[1]):
                    path = (dirpath + "/" + filenames[1])


                #Extract to its directory and import the functions
                try:
                    my_tar = tarfile.open(path)
                    my_tar.extractall(dirpath) # specify which folder to extract to
                    my_tar.close()
                    error = False
                except:
                    print("ERROR:"+ path + ": cannot extract, try extract manually")
                    error = True
                
                if(error == False):
                    '''
                    1:insert the new file path
                    2:check for import syntax error
                    3:import script, create student's model then input to the test cases
                    4:remove the sys path
                    5:write to csv file
                    6:remove import
                    '''
                    try:
                        sys.path.append(dirpath + "/A1/Q2")
                        import polynomial_regression as pr
                        #Q2 grade
                        Q2_grade = Q2.run()
                    except:
                        Q2_grade = 0
                    sys.path.remove(dirpath + "/A1/Q2")

                    print(student_id + " had grades: Q2: %d" %(Q2_grade))

                    #Write to csv file
                    writer.writerow([student_id, Q2_grade])
                    
                    #remove import
                    try:
                        del sys.modules['polynomial_regression']
                    except:pass
```

Summary
------
The logics are simple. Basically I want to share the above command if you need to save your time on marking. So help yourself if you need it.

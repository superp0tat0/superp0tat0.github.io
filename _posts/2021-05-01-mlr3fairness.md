mlr3fairness is a new fairness package that is well integrated into the mlr3 ecosystem. There are three major parts of this package, the fairness metrics, fairness visualizations and debiasing algorithms. It could further help the researchers and industrial users to detect the fairness of datasets or algorithmic bias more easily, which could benefit the accuracy and impartiality of their models built by mlr3.

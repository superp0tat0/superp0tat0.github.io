mlr3fairness is a new fairness package that is well integrated into the mlr3 ecosystem. This new package could be used by many other mlr3 subsystems like mlr3pipelines, mlr3tuning and mlr3proba. It could further help the researchers and industrial users to detect the fairness of datasets or algorithmic bias more easily, which could benefit the accuracy and impartiality of their models built by mlr3. There are three major parts of this package, the fairness metrics, fairness visualizations and debiasing algorithms.

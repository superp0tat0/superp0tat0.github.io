# What is p-value? How does it work?

As a statistical student. I want to start my explanation again with an example of tossing coins. Imagine you have a coin, how could you assess whether this is a fair coin (50% head and 50$ tail)?
 
You could toss the coin multiple times and see whether half of the times you got head. Let us assume you toss 100 times and get 60 heads and 40 tails. You would probably say this coin is biased. But I would like to know how confident you are, since it is possible to get 60 heads and 40 tails. You could either keep tossing until I am satisfied, or you could design a hypothesis test to convince me, in a rigorous statistical way.

## Central Limit Theorem

To better explain what p-value is, we need to introduce the Central Limit Theorem first. We will skip the proof and mathematical definition of the theorem. In our example, if we take head as 1 and tail as 0. We toss the coin 100 times and record the mean of those 100 tosses (should between 0 to 1). Then repeat this process $$n$$ times. We then got a group of tosses meaning $$\bar{X_1}, ... \bar{X_n}$$. Those means will follow a normal distribution $$\mathbb{N}(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{100})$$.

## Move on, to the p-value

Next, let us make an assumption. We assume we have a fair coin, this is our null hypothesis ($$P(head) = 0.5$$). If we increase n from 100, to 1000 then 10000. We could see the following density plot.

n=100       |  n = 1000  |  n = 10000

As we can see it becomes smoother and more like a normal distribution. Where the x-axis represents the mean and y-axis represents the probability density. Then given the observation we had, with 60 heads and 40 tails. I could conclude the probability to have this observation, and even more extreme observations such that heads >= 60 and tails <= 40 will be the area shown below. This area represents a probability of tossing a fair coin 100 times and having more than 60 heads. It has a name **One Side P value**. Cause remember, the probability of having more than 60 heads is the same as having more than 60 tails. If we want to count both sides of the extreme probability, it could be visualized like the area below. So called **Two Side P value**.

If we are clear until here. Then we could use one sentence to conclude p-value : "Assume the null hypothesis is true. P-value is the probability of our observation, and even more extremely observations that happened". If our p-value is small enough, it means that even it is extremely unlikely, but yet we still observed it. This is statistical evidence that we should reject our null hypothesis, cause most likely our null hypothesis is wrong. Usually we set our p-value to be 0.05, but there are some debates going on with this value.

## Problems about p-value?

When we design the experiments and hypothesis tests, we need to came up with an **alternative hypothesis** along with the **null hypothesis**. They are usually opposite, like null hypothesis $$H_0: \mu = 0$$ with alternative hypothesis $$H_1 : \mu \neq 0$$. Then by the p value we could have two conclusions
* "We failed to reject the null hypothesis, so we prefer the null hypothesis"
* "We successfully reject the null hypothesis, so we prefer the alternative hypothesis"
 
Did you see the problem? Since our observation only reflects the **evidence against** the null hypothesis, there is nothing we could say about the alternative hypothesis. So when we design the experiments, we need to be very careful about those two hypotheses.
 
Or, let me introduce Relative Belief. A new statistical analysis approach that could measure both the evidence against, and evidence support of hypothesis.

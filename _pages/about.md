More about me
===

I believe there are connections between different knowledges. Which is the reason I explored more beyond daily schoolwork. I like reading books about economy, psychology and history. All those books are somehow relate to Social Science.

About my blogs. I write them to help me understand, so they may include all different topics. Most of them are data science and statistics related though. "You cannot learn clearly if you cannot teach", that's my way to apply feynman technique. So if you find any problems in the blogs, please comment below. I appreciate all the comments.

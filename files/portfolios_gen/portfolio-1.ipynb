    "## Monte Carlo Tree Search with board games\n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo Tree Search is one famous technique which has been widely used in zero-sum games. MCTS was first introduced in 2006, it is a heuristic search algorithm for decision processes. It combines knowledge from Tree Data Structure, Game Theory and the Monte Carlo Sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS is highly similar to MinMax Tree Search. MinMax Tree Search is also a search algorithm that \"Maximize the minimum gain\". In short, it was designed for zero-sum games to maximize the minimum reward at every decisions. However, MinMax Tree Search is a greedy algorithm, it will search every possible end node of the game states, then justify who is the winner and return the status to the parents' nodes. MinMax could achieve a very high winning rate. But it also has one critical flaw. MinMax Tree has a quadratic time complexity $O(b^m)$. This flaw limits its usage in lots of board games like GO. To deal with this critical flaw, MCTS then been introduced to reduce time complexity. One of the most famous example, AlphaGO, combined both MCTS and deep learning to improve Monte Carlo Sampling and achieved astounding results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of Monte Carlo Tree is simple: Use Monte Carlo to reduce time complexity. Traditionally, MinMax Tree will expand every possible end state and evaluate all of them. However, we could improve this process using Monte Carlo Methods. Since at each incomplete game state, we could expand all the possible moves, then justify the winning rate by running simulations at each move. Then the estimated winning rate will converge to the true winning rate as the amount of simulations increase."

    "We want to formulate the process of Monte Carlo Tree first. If we treat a Monte Carlo Tree search as a black box function. The input of this function will be the current game state. The output of this function will be the next move. Given an example of Tik-Tak-Toe. The input will be the game board and the output will be the estimated optimum move for the given game board. There are 4 main steps in Monte Carlo Tree Search:\n",
    "* **Selection Process:** The selection start from root node R. Then keep select the successive child nodes **strategically** until one leaf node L is reached. We treat the root node R as the input (current game state) of the function. The leaf node L could be any possible successive child node where no simulations has been initialized.\n",
    "* **Expansion Process:** After we select the valid child nodes L. Unless L already be the end state, which either represent WIN=1, LOSE=-1 or a DRAW=0. We will expand node L by creating all possible child nodes of L. Then we randomly select one child node C represent the game state after any possible move from L.\n",
    "* **Simulation Process:** Once we randomly select a child node C. We want to get the estimated winning rate from the current game state C. We then run the Monte Carlo simulations on current game state until the game ends.\n",
    "* **Back Propagation:** We update the information C to R using the results of the simulation.\n",
    "* **Optimization:** We then return the move of current game state with the highest estimated winning rate.\n",
